[{"content":"Abstract Transformers are very powerful for language tasks and training is ****faster on GPUs because of parallization, but they use a lot of memory and computing power, especially when processing long text, their cost grows very fast (quadratically).\nRNNs, on the other hand, use less memory and computation cause they grow linearly but are slower to train and not as good at handling long sentences.\nThe new model RWKV mixes the good parts of both, it trains quickly and gets good performance like a Transformer and also runs efficiently like an RNN.\nMemory and computation:\nIn a Transformer, each token looks at every other token through self-attention. If you have N tokens in a sentence, it compares every pair, so total comparisons = N × N = N². That’s why Memory and computation both grow quadratically. In an RNN, the model reads tokens one by one, passing information step by step. So for N tokens, it just does N steps, the total cost = N (linear). 1 Introduction RWKV reformulates the attention mechanism with a variant of linear attention, replacing traditional dot-product token interaction with more effective channel-directed attention. This implementation, without approximation, offers the lowest computational and memory complexity.\n2 Background 2.1 Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) Popular RNN architectures such as LSTM and GRU. Although these RNNs can be factored into two linear blocks (W and U) and an RNN-specific block, the data dependency relying on previous time steps prohibits parallelizing these typical RNNs.\n$$ \\begin{aligned} f_t \u0026= \\sigma_g\\left(W_f x_t + U_f h_{t-1} + b_f\\right), \\\\ i_t \u0026= \\sigma_g\\left(W_i x_t + U_i h_{t-1} + b_i\\right), \\\\ o_t \u0026= \\sigma_g\\left(W_o x_t + U_o h_{t-1} + b_o\\right), \\\\ \\tilde{c}_t \u0026= \\sigma_c\\left(W_c x_t + U_c h_{t-1} + b_c\\right), \\\\ c_t \u0026= f_t \\odot c_{t-1} + i_t \\odot \\tilde{c}_t, \\\\ h_t \u0026= o_t \\odot \\sigma_h(c_t). \\end{aligned} $$ Model Depends on Parallelizable? RNN computed previous state ❌ No RWKV raw previous input ✅ Yes (for training) 2.2 Transformers and AFT Standard Transformer self-attention Matrix form\n$$ \\text{Attn}{Attn}(Q,K,V)=\\text{softmax}(QK^\\top)V $$ Per token (t)\n$$ \\text{Attn}{Attn}(Q,K,V)_t=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{T}\\exp(q_t^\\top k_i) \\odot v_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{T}\\exp(q_t^\\top k_i)} $$ The weighted value equation in multi-head attention. Weight of token $i$ for query $t$ is $\\exp(q_t^\\top k_i)$. Output is a weighted average of $v_i$ AFT (Attention-Free Transformer) variant $$ \\text{Attn}{Attn}^{+}(W,K,V)_t=\\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{t}\\exp(w_{t,i}+k_i)\\odot v_i}{\\sum_{i=1}^{t}\\exp(w_{t,i}+k_i)} $$ Replace $q_t^\\top k_i$ with (learned) position bias $w_{t,i}$ + a key score $k_i$. Causal: sum only $i\\le t$. Still a normalized weighted average, but weights depend on position via $w_{t,i}$. Variables:\ni: past token index, what we’re reading from memory t: current token index, what we’re generating now RWKV’s simplification Define the bias as a decay with distance:\n$$ w_{t,i}=-(t-i)w \\qquad w\\in(\\mathbb{R}{\\ge 0})^d $$ Per-channel vector $w$ ⇒ older tokens get weight $e^{-(t-i)w}\\le 1$. Now weights depend only on how far back a token is, not on $q_t$. This structure lets us keep running sums, so we don’t need all pairwise scores. Result:\nSame attention-like effect, but computed with O(T) time and O(1) memory per step (like an RNN), while still trainable in parallel across tokens (like a Transformer) by prefix-scan tricks.\nModel Has Query? How it computes weights Complexity Key idea Transformer ✅ Yes all tokens attend to all O(N²) Full pairwise attention, strong but heavy AFT ❌ No Uses position bias O(N) Removes query, uses learned positional weights RWKV ❌ No Adds time-decay weights O(N) AFT idea + RNN-style update (linear, efficient) 3 RWKV Four fundamental elements:\nR: The Receptance vector acts as the receiver of past information. W: The Weight signifies the positional weight decay vector, a trainable parameter within the model. K: The Key vector performs a role analogous to K in traditional attention mechanisms. V: The Value vector functions similarly to V in conventional attention processes. The difference between Time Mix and Channel Mix:\nTime Mix: Builds each token’s vector using time order and previous token info Channel Mix: Refines each token’s vector by mixing internal dimensions (features). It processes each token separately to mix and refine its feature channels. 3.1 Architecture The RWKV model is composed of stacked residual blocks. Each block consists of a time-mixing and a channel-mixing sub-block, embodying recurrent structures to leverage past information.\nThis model uses a unique attention-like score update process, which includes a time-dependent softmax operation improving numerical stability and mitigating vanishing gradients. It ensures that the gradient is propagated along the most relevant path. Additionally, layer normalization incorporated within the architecture aids in stabilizing the gradients, effectively addressing both vanishing and exploding gradient issues.\n3.1.1 Token Shift In this architecture, all linear projection vectors (R, K, V in time-mixing, and R′, K′ in channel- mixing) involved in computations are produced by linear interpolation between current and previous timestep inputs, facilitating a token shift.\nThe vectors for time-mixing computation are linear projections of linear combinations of the current and previous inputs of the block:\n$$ \\begin{aligned} r_t \u0026= W_r \\cdot \\left(\\mu_r \\odot x_t + (1 - \\mu_r) \\odot x_{t-1}\\right), \\\\ k_t \u0026= W_k \\cdot \\left(\\mu_k \\odot x_t + (1 - \\mu_k) \\odot x_{t-1}\\right), \\\\ v_t \u0026= W_v \\cdot \\left(\\mu_v \\odot x_t + (1 - \\mu_v) \\odot x_{t-1}\\right). \\end{aligned} $$ The channel-mixing inputs:\n$$ \\begin{aligned} r'_t \u0026= W'_{r} \\cdot \\left(\\mu'_{r} \\odot x_t + (1 - \\mu'_{r}) \\odot x_{t-1}\\right), \\\\ k'_t \u0026= W'_{k} \\cdot \\left(\\mu'_{k} \\odot x_t + (1 - \\mu'_{k}) \\odot x_{t-1}\\right). \\end{aligned} $$ 3.1.2 WKV Operator $$ wkv_t = \\frac{\\sum_{i=1}^{t-1} e^{-(t-1-i)w + k_i} \\odot v_i + e^{u + k_t} \\odot v_t}{\\sum_{i=1}^{t-1} e^{-(t-1-i)w + k_i} + e^{u + k_t}} $$ The difference of treating W between AFT and RWKV:\nPairwise matrix: Each token pair has its own weight Channel-wise vector: One decay weight per feature channel 3.1.3 Output Gating Time Mixing:\n$$ o_t = W_o \\cdot (\\sigma(r_t) \\odot wkv_t) $$ Channel Mixing:\n$$ o'_t = \\sigma(r'_t) \\odot (W'_v \\cdot \\max(k'_t, 0)^2) $$ 4 Trained Models and Computing Costs Adam optimizer, bfloat16 precision, the auxiliary loss introduced by PaLM…\n4.2 Scaling Laws Scaling laws in language models refer to the mathematical relationships that describe how the performance of a language model changes with respect to various factors.\nScaling laws are important for two primary reasons:\nthey allow us to make predictions and plans regarding the costs and performance of large models before they are trained via interpolation and extrapolation. the contexts in which they fail provides rich feedback on important areas for future research. Explain Interpolation and Extrapolation:\nInterpolation: predicting within the range of data you already know. For example, you trained models with 1B, 5B, and 10B parameters, then you interpolate to guess how a 7B model will perform. Extrapolation: predicting beyond the known range. For example, you trained up to 10B, and now you try to estimate performance of a 100B model. 5 Evaluation Evaluation direction and questions:\nCompetitiveness: Tests if RWKV performs as well as Transformers when both use the same computing power.\nLong Context: Tests if RWKV can handle very long texts better than Transformers,\nespecially when Transformers become too slow or costly for long sequences.\n6 Inference Experiments float32 precision, the HuggingFace Transformers,\n7 Future Work 1. Increase Model Expressivity\nImprove time-decay formulas. Explore better initialization of model states. Goal: more powerful representations without losing efficiency. 2. Improve Computational Efficiency\nUse parallel scan in $wkv_t$ step. Target complexity: $O(B \\log(T)d)$. 3. Apply to Encoder–Decoder Architectures\nReplace cross-attention with RWKV mechanism. Useful for seq2seq and multimodal models. Boosts efficiency in both training and inference. 4. Use of Model State (Context)\nUsed for interpretability and predictability. Could enhance safety and control via prompt tuning. Modify hidden states to guide model behavior. 5. Larger Internal States\nImprove long-term memory and context understanding. Increase performance across various tasks. 8 Conclusion We introduced RWKV, a new approach to RNN models exploiting the potential of time-based mixing components. RWKV introduces several key strategies that allow it to capture locality and long-range dependencies while addressing limitations of current architectures by: (1) replacing the quadratic QK attention with a scalar formulation at linear cost, (2) reformulating recurrence and sequential inductive biases to enable efficient training parallelization and efficient inference, and (3) enhancing training dynamics using custom initializations.\nWe benchmark the proposed architecture in a wide variety of NLP tasks and show comparable performance to SoTA with reduced cost. Further experiments on expressivity, interpretability, and scaling showcase the model capabilities and draw parallels in behavior between RWKV and other LLMs.\nRWKV opens a new route for scalable and efficient architectures to model complex relationships in sequential data. While many alternatives to Transformers have been proposed with similar claims, ours is the first to back up those claims with pretrained models with tens of billions of parameters.\n9 Limitations 1. Performance Limitation (Memory Loss over Long Contexts)\nLinear attention is efficient but may lose fine details over long sequences. RWKV compresses history into a single vector, unlike Transformers that keep all token interactions. Its recurrent design limits ability to fully “look back” at distant tokens. 2. Dependence on Prompt Engineering\nRWKV relies more on well-designed prompts than Transformers. Poor prompts may cause information loss between prompt and continuation.

Introduction Extension of Abstract.\nSequence Modeling: Recurrent language modelsExtension of Abstract.\nOperate step-by-step, processing one token or time step at a time. one input + hidden state → one output + hidden state (update every time) e.g., RNNs, LSTMs Encoder-decoder architectures\nComposed of two RNNs (or other models): one to encode input into a representation another to decode it into the output sequence one input + hidden state → … → hidden state → one output + hidden state → … e.g., seq2seq Disadvantages about these two: Recurrent models preclude parallelization, so it’s not good.\nEncoder-decoder models have used attention to pass the stuff from encoder to decoder more effectively.\nAttention doesn’t use recurrence and entirely relies on an attention mechanism to draw glabal dependencies between input and output. 2. Background Corresponding Work:\nSpeak clearly about the corresponding papers, the connections between u and the papers, and the differences.\nReduce sequential computation: Typically use convolutional neural networks → the number of operations grows in the distance between positions → transfomer: a constant number of operations\nat the cost of reduced effective resolution due to averaging attention-weighted positions we counteract this bad effect with Multi-Head Attention Self-attention: compute a representation of the sequence based on different positions\nEnd-to-end memory networks: ✔ Reccurrence attention mechanism\n❌ Sequence-aligned recurrence\nTransformer: The first transduction model relying entirely on self-attention to do encoder-decoder model. ( to compute representations of its input and output without using sequence-aligned RNNs or convolution)\ntransduction model refers to making predictions or inferences about specific instances based on the data at hand, without relying on a prior generalization across all possible examples, which is different from Inductive learning.\n3. Model Architecture The Transformer uses stacked self-attention and point-wise, fully connected layers for both the encoder and the decoder.\nEncoder: maps an input sequence of symbol representations x → a sequence of continuous representations z. Decoder: given z, generates an output sequence of symbols one element at a time. At each step, the model is auto-regressive. Why Using LayerNorm not BatchNorm? LayerNorm normalizes across features of a single sample, suitable for variable-length sequences.\nBatchNorm normalizes across the batch, which can be inconsistent for sequence tasks.\n3.1 Encoder and Decoder Stacks Encoder N = 6 identical layers, each layer has two sub-layers.\nmulti-head self-attention mechanism simple, position-wise fully connected feed-forward network For each sub-layer, connect a layer normalization and a residual connection.\ndimension of output = 512\nDecoder N = 6 identical layers, each layer has three sub-layers.\nmasked multi-head attention over the output of the encoder stack multi-head self-attention mechanism simple, position-wise fully connected feed-forward network For each sub-layer, connect a layer normalization and a residual connection.\n3.2 Attention An attention function can be described as mapping a query and a set of key-value pairs to an output where the query, keys, values, and output are all vectors.\nThe output is computed as a weighted sum of the values, where the weight assigned to each value is computed by a compatibility function of the query with the corresponding key.\n( Given a query, output is computed by similarity between query and keys, then different keys have different weights, next combine the values based on the weights. )\n3.2.1 Scaled Dot-Product Attention We compute the dot products of the query with all keys, divide each by length of query √, and apply a softmax function to obtain the weights on the values.\nWhy divide each by length of query √ ?\nIt prevents the input to the softmax from becoming excessively large, ensuring that the softmax outputs remain well-distributed and numerically stable. The softmax function normalize the scores into probabilities, but it doesn\u0026rsquo;t address the problem of large input magnitudes directly. If the inputs to softmax are extremely large, the e^x can become numerically unstable, leading to issues in computation.\nn refers to the length of a sequence, the number of the words.\ndk refers to the length of the one word vector.\nm refers to the number of the target words.\ndv refers to the length of the one target word vector.\nWhat there is a function of the Mask?\nWhen computing the output, I only use the key-value pairs up to the current time and do not use any later key-value pairs.\n3.2.2 Multi-Head Attention Linear projection, just like lots of channels.\nLinearly project the queries, keys and values h times to low dimensions with different, learned linear projections.\nFinally, these are concatenated (stack) and once again projected.\nWe emply h = 8 parallel attention layers, or heads.\nSo for each layer or head, we make their dimension to 64 to make the total computational cost is similar to single-head attention.\n3.2.3 Application of Attention in our Model The Transformer uses multi-head attention in three different ways:\nIn “encoder-decoder attention” layers, queries → previous decoder layer keys and values → the output of the encoder In “encoder self-attention” layers, keys, values and queries all come from the previous layer in the encoder In “decoder self-attention” layers, keys, values and queries all come from the previous layer in the decoder allow each position in the decoder to attend to all positions in the decoder up to and including that position 3.3 Position-wise Feed-Forward Networks The fully connected feed-forward network is applied to each position separately and identically.\nThe Multi-Head Attention has already get the location information, now we need to add more expression ability by adding non-linear.\nThe output and MLP patterns are the same. The difference are the input source.\n3.4 Embedding and Softmax Embedding convert the input tokens to vectors of dimension ( 512 ), then multiply those weights by\n$\\sqrt {d_{models}}$\nWhy multiply those weights by $\\sqrt {d_{models}}$ ?\nTo boosts the magnitude, making it more aligned with other components of the model. Because the initial value is between 0~1 by using normal distribution.\nWe update the L2 norm of the embeddings to 1 finally, so we need to ensure the value of each dimension not too small. The L2 norm value of a vector to 1 is best to express a word, because it only express direction.\nSoftmax convert the decoder output to predicted next-token probabilities.\n3.5 Positional Encoding The order change, but the values don’t change. So we add the sequential information to the input.\nWe use sine and cosine functions of different frequencies [-1, 1]\n4. Why Self-Attention Length of a word → d Number of words → n Self-Attention → n words ✖️ every words need to multiply with n words and for each two words do d multiplying. Recurrent → d-dimension vector multiply d✖️d matrix, n times Convolutional → k kernel_size, n words, d^2 input_channels ✖️ output_channels (Draw picture clear) Self-Attention (restricted) → r the number of neighbors It seems like Self-Attention architecture has lots of advantages, but it needs more data and bigger model to train to achieve the same effect.\n5. Training 5.1 Training Data and Batching Sentences were encoded using byte-pair encoding, which has a shared source-target vocabulary of about 37000 tokens. → So we share the same weight matrix between the two embedding layers and the pre-softmax linear transformation.\n5.2 Hardware and Schedule 5.3 Optimizer 5.4 Regularization Residual Dropout Label Smoothing 6.

Value Network: Evaluates board positions → the likelihood of winning. Training Pipeline: Supervised Learning (SL) from expert human games to imitate professional play. Reinforcement Learning (RL) through self-play, improving beyond human strategies. Integration with MCTS: Combines the predictive power of neural networks with efficient search. Reduces: breadth (number of moves to consider) depth (number of steps to simulate) of search. MCTS It first adds all legal moves (children) under the current position in the tree. In every simulation, AlphaGo chooses one branch to go deeper into the tree (not all of them). It decides which one based on three main metrics: Policy Prior (P) → the probability of the move from policy network Visit Count (N) → how many times we’ve already explored this move during simulations. Q-Value (Q) → average win rate from past simulations Symbol Meaning Source Role in decision P(s,a) Policy prior (initial move probability) From policy network Guides initial exploration N(s,a) Number of times this move was explored Counted during simulations Balances exploration vs exploitation Q(s,a) Average predicted win rate (past experience) From value network results of simulations Exploitation: “keep doing what worked” Results:\nWithout search, AlphaGo already played at the level of strong Go programs. With the neural-network-guided MCTS, AlphaGo achieved a 99.8% win rate against other programs. It became the first program ever to defeat a human professional Go player (Fan Hui, European champion) by 5–0. Introduction Optimal value function $v^*(s)$ For any game state $s$, there exists a theoretical function that tells who will win if both players play perfectly. Computing this function exactly means searching through all possible sequences of moves. Search space explosion Total possibilities ≈ $b^d$, where $b$: number of legal moves (breadth), $d$: game length (depth). For Go: ( $b$ ≈ 250, $d$ ≈ 150) → bigggg number → impossible to compute exhaustively. Reducing the search space — two key principles: (1) Reduce depth using an approximate value function $v(s)$: Stop (truncate) deep search early. Use an approximate evaluator to predict how good a position is instead of exploring all future moves. This worked in chess, checkers, and Othello, but was believed to be impossible (“intractable”) for Go because Go’s positions are much more complex. (2) Reduce breadth using a policy $p(a|s)$: Instead of exploring all moves, only sample the most likely or promising ones. This narrows down which actions/moves to consider, saving enormous computation. Example: Monte Carlo rollouts: Simulate random games (using the policy) to estimate how good a position is. Maximum depth without branching at all, by sampling long sequences of actions for both players from a policy $p$. This method led to strong results in simpler games (backgammon, Scrabble), and weak amateur level in Go before AlphaGo. “Simulate” and “Roll out” basically mean the same thing in this context.\n“Simulate” → a general word: to play out an imaginary game in your head or computer. “Roll out” → a more specific term from Monte Carlo methods, meaning “play random moves from the current position until the game ends.” So → every rollout is one simulation of a complete (or partial) game.\nrollout = one simulated playthrough. Monte Carlo Rollout Monte Carlo rollout estimates how good a position is by:\nStarting from a given board position (s). Playing many simulated games to the end (using policy-guided moves → reduce breadth). Recording each game’s result (+1 for win, −1 for loss). Averaging all outcomes to estimate the win probability for that position. $$ v(s) \\approx \\text{average(win/loss results from rollouts)} $$\nGoal:\nApproximate the value function $v(s)$, the expected chance of winning from position $s$.\nIt’s simple but inefficient — great for small games, too slow and noisy for Go.\nMonte Carlo tree search MCTS uses Monte Carlo rollouts to estimate the value of each state. As more simulations are done, the search tree grows and values become more accurate. It can theoretically reach optimal play, but earlier Go programs used shallow trees and simple, hand-crafted policies or linear value functions (not deep learning). These older methods were limited because Go’s search space was too large. Training pipeline of AlphaGo Deep convolutional neural networks (CNNs) can represent board positions much better. So AlphaGo uses CNNs to reduce the search complexity in two ways: Evaluating positions with a value network → replaces long rollouts (reduces search depth). Sampling moves with a policy network → focuses on likely moves (reduces search breadth). Together, this lets AlphaGo explore much more efficiently than traditional MCTS. Supervised Learning (SL) Policy Network $p_\\sigma$: trained from human expert games. Fast Policy Network $p_\\pi$: used to quickly generate moves during rollouts. Reinforcement Learning (RL) Policy Network $p_\\rho$: improves the SL policy through self-play, optimizing for winning instead of just imitating humans. Value Network $v_\\theta$: predicts the winner from any board position based on self-play outcomes. Final AlphaGo system = combines policy + value networks inside MCTS for strong decision-making. Supervised learning of policy networks Panel(a): Better policy-network accuracy in predicting expert moves → stronger actual gameplay performance.\nThis proves that imitation learning (supervised policy $p_σ$) already provides meaningful playing ability before any reinforcement learning or MCTS.\nFast Rollout Policy networks $p_\\pi(a|s)$\nA simpler and faster version of the policy network used during rollouts in MCTS. Uses a linear softmax model on small board-pattern features (not deep CNN). Much lower accuracy (24.2 %) but extremely fast takes only 2 µs per move (vs. 3 ms for the full SL policy). Trained with the same supervised learning principle on human moves. Reinforcement learning of policy networks Structure of the policy network = SL policy network initial weights ρ = σ Step What happens What’s learned Initialize Copy weights from SL policy (ρ = σ) Start with human-like play Self-play Pick current p and an older version p Generate thousands of full games (self-play) Reward +1 for win, −1 for loss Label each move sequence, and collect experience (state, action, final reward) Update Update weights ρ by SGD Policy network Repeat Thousands of games Stronger, self-improving policy Reinforcement learning of value networks Step What happens What’s learned Initialize Start from the trained RL policy network; use it to generate self-play games Provides realistic, high-level gameplay data Self-play RL policy network plays millions of games against itself Produce diverse board positions and their final outcomes (+1 win / −1 loss) Sampling Randomly select one position per game to form 30 M independent (state, outcome) pairs Avoids correlation between similar positions Labeling Each position (s) labeled with the final game result (z) Links every board state to its real win/loss outcome Training Train the value network (v_θ(s)) by minimizing MSE Learns to predict winning probability directly from a position Evaluation Compare against Monte Carlo rollouts (pπ, pρ) Matches rollout accuracy with 15 000× less computation Result MSE ≈ 0.23 (train/test), strong generalization Reliable position evaluation for use in MCTS Problem of naive approach of predicting game outcomes from data consisting of complete games:\nThe value network was first trained on all positions from the same human games. Consecutive positions were almost identical and had the same win/loss label. The network memorized whole games instead of learning real position evaluation → overfitting (MSE = 0.37 test). Solution\nGenerate a new dataset: 30 million self-play games, take only one random position per game. Each sample is independent, so the network must learn general Go patterns, not memorize. Result: good generalization (MSE ≈ 0.23) and accurate position evaluation. Searching with policy and value networks (MCTS) Panel Step What happens Which network helps a Selection Traverse the tree from root to a leaf by selecting the move with the highest combined score Q + u(P). Uses Q-values (average win) and policy priors P (from policy network). b Expansion When reaching a leaf (a position never explored before), expand it: generate its possible moves and initialize their prior probabilities using the policy network RL policy network c Evaluation Evaluate this new position in two ways: ① Value network (v_θ(s)): predicts win probability instantly. ② Rollout with fast policy p_π: quickly play random moves to the end, get final result (r). Value net + Fast policy d Backup Send the evaluation result (average of (v_θ(s)) and (r)) back up the tree — update each parent node’s Q-value (mean of all results from that branch). None directly (update step) The core idea Each possible move/edge (s, a) in the MCTS tree stores 3 key values:\nSymbol Meaning Source P(s,a) Prior probability — how promising this move looks before searching From the policy network N(s,a) How many times this move has been tried From search statistics Q(s,a) Average win rate from playing move a at state s From past simulations Step 1: Selection — choose which move to explore next At each step of a simulation, AlphaGo selects the move $a_t$ that maximizes:\n$$ a_t = \\arg\\max_a [Q(s_t, a) + u(s_t, a)] $$\nwhere the bonus term $u(s,a)$ encourages exploration:\n$$ u(s,a) \\propto \\frac{P(s,a)}{1 + N(s,a)} $$\n$Q(s,a)$: “How good this move has proven so far.” $u(s,a)$: “How much we should still explore this move.” → Moves that are both good (high Q) and underexplored (low N) get priority.\nAs N increases, the bonus term shrinks — the search gradually focuses on the best moves.\nStep 2: Expansion When the search reaches a leaf (a position not yet in the tree):\nThe policy network $p_\\sigma(a|s)$ outputs a probability for each legal move. Those values are stored as new P(s,a) priors for the new node. Initially $N(s,a) = 0$ $Q(s,a) = 0$ Now the tree has grown — this new node represents a new possible future board.\nStep 3: Evaluation — estimate how good the leaf is Each leaf position $s_L$ is evaluated in two ways:\nValue network $v_θ(s_L)$: directly predicts win probability. Rollout result $z_L$: fast simulation (using the fast rollout policy $p_π$) until the game ends +1 if win −1 if loss. Then AlphaGo combines the two results:\n$$ V(s_L) = (1 - λ)v_θ(s_L) + λz_L $$\n$λ$ = mixing parameter (balances between value net and rollout). If $λ$ = 0.5, both count equally. Step 4: Backup — update the tree statistics The leaf’s evaluation $V(s_L)$ is propagated back up the tree:\nEvery move (edge) $(s, a)$ that was used to reach that leaf gets updated:\n$$ N(s,a) = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} 1(s,a,i) $$\n$$ Q(s,a) = \\frac{1}{N(s,a)} \\sum_{i=1}^{n} 1(s,a,i) V(s_L^i) $$\n$1(s,a,i)$ = 1 if that move was part of the i-th simulation, else 0. $V(s_L^i)$ = evaluation result from that simulation’s leaf. So, Q(s,a) becomes the average value of all evaluations ( $r$ and $vθ$) in its subtree.\nStep 5: Final move decision After thousands of simulations, the root node has a set of moves with:\n$P(s_0, a)$: from policy network, $Q(s_0, a)$: average win rate, $N(s_0, a)$: visit counts. AlphaGo chooses the move with the highest visit count (N) — the most explored and trusted move.\nWhy SL policy network performed better than RL policy network for MCTS?\nPolicy Behavior Effect in MCTS SL policy Mimics human experts → gives a diverse set of good moves MCTS can explore several promising branches efficiently RL policy Optimized for winning → focuses too narrowly on top 1–2 moves MCTS loses diversity → gets less exploration benefit So, for MCTS’s exploration stage, a broader prior (SL policy) performs better.\nBut for value estimation, the RL value network is superior — because it predicts winning chances more accurately.\nImplementation detail Evaluating policy \u0026amp; value networks takes much more compute than classical search. AlphaGo used: 40 search threads, 48 CPUs, 8 GPUs for parallel evaluation. The final system ran asynchronous multi-threaded search: CPUs handle the tree search logic, GPUs compute policy and value network evaluations in parallel. This allowed AlphaGo to efficiently combine deep learning with massive search.\nAll programs were allowed 5 s of computation time per move.\nDiscussion In this work we have developed a Go program, based on a combination of deep neural networks and tree search. We have developed, for the first time, effective move selection and position evaluation functions for Go, based on deep neural networks that are trained by a novel combination of supervised and reinforcement learning. We have introduced a new search algorithm that successfully combines neural network evaluations with Monte Carlo rollouts. Our program AlphaGo integrates these components together, at scale, in a high-performance tree search engine.\nSelect those positions more intelligently, using the policy network, and evaluating them more precisely, using the value network. Policy network → “probability of choosing a move”\nValue network → “probability of winning from a position”\n","permalink":"/posts/mastering-go-mcts/","summary":"\u003ch1 id=\"abstract\"\u003eAbstract\u003c/h1\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eThe game of Go:\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThe most challenging of classic games for AI, because:\u003c/p\u003e\n\u003cul\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eEnormous search space\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003cli\u003eThe difficulty of evaluating board positions and moves\u003c/li\u003e\n\u003c/ul\u003e\n\u003ctable\u003e\n  \u003cthead\u003e\n      \u003ctr\u003e\n          \u003cth\u003eConcept\u003c/th\u003e\n          \u003cth\u003eMeaning\u003c/th\u003e\n          \u003cth\u003eExample in Go\u003c/th\u003e\n          \u003cth\u003eAI Solution\u003c/th\u003e\n      \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/thead\u003e\n  \u003ctbody\u003e\n      \u003ctr\u003e\n          \u003ctd\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eEnormous search space\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\n          \u003ctd\u003eToo many possible moves and future paths → impossible to explore all\u003c/td\u003e\n          \u003ctd\u003eAt every turn, Go has ~250 legal moves; across 150 moves → (250^{150}) possibilities\u003c/td\u003e\n          \u003ctd\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ePolicy network\u003c/strong\u003e narrows down the choices (reduces \u003cem\u003ebreadth\u003c/em\u003e of search)\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003c/tr\u003e\n      \u003ctr\u003e\n          \u003ctd\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eHard-to-evaluate positions\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/td\u003e\n          \u003ctd\u003eEven if you know the board, it’s hard to know who’s winning\u003c/td\u003e\n          \u003ctd\u003eHumans can’t easily assign a numeric score to a mid-game position\u003c/td\u003e\n          \u003ctd\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eValue network\u003c/strong\u003e predicts win probability (reduces \u003cem\u003edepth\u003c/em\u003e of search)\u003c/td\u003e\n      \u003c/tr\u003e\n  \u003c/tbody\u003e\n\u003c/table\u003e\n\u003chr\u003e\n\u003ch2 id=\"alphago\"\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eAlphaGo\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/h2\u003e\n\u003caside\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eImagine AlphaGo is a \u003cem\u003esmart player\u003c/em\u003e who has:\u003c/p\u003e","title":"Mastering the game of Go with MCTS and Deep Neural Networks"}]
